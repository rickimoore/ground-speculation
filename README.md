In the shadow of ‘Peak Soil’, fertile soils are becoming more and more scarce leading to an escalating competition worldwide around this undervalued, but precious resource. The crucial role of healthy soil for the planet’s ecosystem has been, so far, the main focus of past attempts to face global soil loss. As various discourses and conflicts around the ownership of soil are rising worldwide, it is urgent to address soil in a more complex and nuanced manner – not just as an ecological problem but as a cultural, social and political issue. 

In order to provoke change, we need to seek new ways of engaging and thinking about what is under our feet, building an alternative soil culture within local and global scales. Unconventional approaches such as soil transplants and the inclusion of indigenous knowledge are considered as potential answers while challenging societal frameworks, namely the accessibility and ownership of resources. By combining a mythological and an analytical layer, this thesis confronts the imagery of the Garden of Eden, a utopian vision of fertility, with scientific, artistic and theoretical resources of past and present perspectives. Providing the grounds to speculate about the intertwined politics of soil, land and people, it encourages us to reconsider our relation to a material fundamental to our human existence – as individuals, societies and species.
